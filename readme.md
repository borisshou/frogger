# A Frogger Game in Java

## Introduction

In this Frogger game, user is a frog who aims to go from one side of a pond to another by landing on floating logs. The logs float on the pond in different directions. User avoids jumping into the pond or onto broken logs. Rubies will give additional lives so that the frog may die multiple times before losing the game.

**Note: Frogger did a few improvements on the original Nifty scrolling game**
- There are instructions being displayed before the game starts, and users press any key to continue reading the instructions. 
- In the game, there is a background, and all moving elements are shown in images.
- Users are able to move both vertically and horizontally.
- Users are restricted on the places they could move to, i.e. they could only move in between logs.
- Users have to pay attention to the location of the frog, because it is being carried away by the logs.
- Users have a clear sense of what the goal is by looking at the game display. They know that they only need to go from the left to the right without dying.
- There is a less complex scoring scheme. Users can focus entirely on the game without looking at the title of the grid to keep track of their scores.
